============

Completed Mini Project 3. Project requirements can be found at: http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2013fa/40814/projects.html

Project Guidelines:

In this mini project, we teach our app how to use its sensors. Specifically, we focus on the accelerometer sensor. The minimum requirements for your app are:
It collects acceleration and related information from the on-device accelerometer and gyroscope.
It displays the collected information using simple animation, e.g., this could be a graph, a ball bouncing around the screen, or some other object that is animated by the movements of the device.
The object can also be interacted with, e.g., a moving ball freezes when you touch it and unfreezes when you let go.
You will need to learn about animation on mobile devices and there are no limits to what you can implement, e.g., it can be a simple reaction test game, a game that measures your hand's "stability", a balancing game, or an app that measures how strong your punch is.
